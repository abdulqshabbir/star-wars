# TODO
[X] Let user search character by name
- [X] Store input field text in react state
- [ ] On click of submit button (or Enter keypress), make a request to server to search for people with name
- [X] Once response is recieved, update the people context so that the star wars characters re-render

## Wireframes
Below are three wireframes that I'll use (created myself using Figma) for prototyping the design of the home page, character page as well as the search feature. These wireframes will help me identify the necessary React components I need as well as think about the functionality in the backend needed to create each view.
